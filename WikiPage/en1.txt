                        <p>James "Jim" Moriarty was the world's only "consulting criminal"; a stark contrast to his arch nemesis is Sherlock Holmes' similarly 
                            unrivaled "consulting detective" occupation.
                        </p>
                        <p>Just like Sherlock Holmes, Moriarty was highly intelligent, a master manipulator, making it even more difficult for 
                            Sherlock to predict his next move. Other personality traits are machiavellianness, cunning, and short-tempered.

                        <p>Moriarty was obsessed with Sherlock Holmes, enjoying his role as a villain showing indifference to others' 
                            lives. He killed or organized the murder of innocents as a hobby. Moriarty thought of life as boring, using
                             Holmes as a source of entertainment. Therefore, when felt he had defeated Holmes, he did not hesitate to 
                             commit suicide. Thus, being Holmes' nemesis was his only life purpose, convinced that if he killed himself, 
                             Sherlocks' fate would be forced to follow the same path.

                        <p>He is extremely arrogant. Moriarty thought of himself as the perfect opponent to Holmes given his clever 
                            strategies and intellectual genius. Often, he displayed a lack of social connection, as well as extreme 
                            psychopathy and narcissism. Another Moriarty staple is ruthlessness, leaving sarcasm, irony, and a sadistic 
                            sense of humor in every appearance, having a habit of intimidating or picking on his rivals.
